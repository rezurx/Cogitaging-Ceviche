# RSS Feed Fix - July 1, 2025

## Issue Summary

The `ingest_external_articles.py` script was experiencing "Malformed RSS feed" warnings when attempting to ingest articles from Conrad T. Hannon's Substack. The script would run but fail to import any Substack content.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem:** The configured Substack URL (`https://conradthannon.substack.com/feed`) was returning HTML content instead of valid RSS/XML feed data.

**Investigation Method:**
- Used `curl` to fetch the feed URL directly
- Discovered the URL was returning a full HTML page instead of RSS content
- Analyzed the author's actual Substack profile to identify correct publication URLs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Identified Correct RSS Feed URLs

Found that Conrad T. Hannon publishes on two separate Substack publications:
- **The Cogitating Ceviche**: `https://thecogitatingceviche.substack.com/feed`
- **The Cybernetic Ceviche**: `https://thecyberneticceviche.substack.com/feed`

Both URLs return valid RSS/XML content when tested with `curl`.

### 2. Updated Configuration

Modified `ingest_external_articles.py` to replace the broken source:

**Before:**
```python
SOURCES = {
    "substack": {
        "type": "rss",
        "url": "https://conradthannon.substack.com/feed"
    },
    # ... other sources
}
```

**After:**
```python
SOURCES = {
    "cogitating-ceviche": {
        "type": "rss",
        "url": "https://thecogitatingceviche.substack.com/feed"
    },
    "cybernetic-ceviche": {
        "type": "rss",
        "url": "https://thecyberneticceviche.substack.com/feed"
    },
    # ... other sources remain unchanged
}
```

### 3. Verification

Ran the updated script successfully:
- **Cogitating Ceviche**: 20 articles imported
- **Cybernetic Ceviche**: 20 articles imported  
- **Medium**: All existing articles detected (no duplicates)
- **Vocal**: All existing articles detected (no duplicates)

**Total Result:** 40+ new articles successfully ingested with zero malformation warnings.

## Technical Details

### Commands Used for Verification:
```bash
# Test original broken URL
curl -L -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" "https://conradthannon.substack.com/feed" | head -50

# Test working URLs
curl -L -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" "https://thecogitatingceviche.substack.com/feed" | head -20
curl -L -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" "https://thecyberneticceviche.substack.com/feed" | head -20

# Run updated script
python3 ingest_external_articles.py
```

### File Locations:
- **Script**: `/home/resurx/websites/cogitating-ceviche/ingest_external_articles.py`
- **Generated Content**: `/home/resurx/websites/cogitating-ceviche/content/external-articles/`
- **Progress Tracker**: `/home/resurx/websites/cogitating-ceviche/progress_tracker.md`

## Website Deployment

Used the established build-and-serve process for reliable viewing:

```bash
# Build static site
hugo --gc --minify

# Serve from public directory  
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8080 &
```

Website successfully accessible via VSCode port forwarding on port 8080.

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…

- RSS feed ingestion now fully functional
- All content sources working (Substack, Medium, Vocal)
- Zero malformation warnings
- 90+ total articles now available on the website
- External Articles section populated with new content

## Future Maintenance

The RSS feeds should continue working reliably. If issues arise:
1. Test feed URLs directly with `curl`
2. Check for changes in Substack's URL structure
3. Verify `feedparser` library compatibility
4. Monitor for any new publications from the author

This fix ensures the cogitating-ceviche website has a robust, multi-source content ingestion system.
