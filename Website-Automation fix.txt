The job failed because the Python script tried to import the yaml module, but it isn't installed in the environment:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'
```
This error occurred in automation_manager.py at import yaml.

## Solution

Add PyYAML as a dependency so it's installed before the script runs.

### If you use requirements.txt:
Add this line to requirements.txt:
```txt
PyYAML
```

### If you install dependencies in your workflow file:
Add this step before running your Python script in .github/workflows/automation.yml:
```yaml
- name: Install PyYAML
  run: pip install PyYAML
```

### Example workflow snippet:
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    with:
      python-version: "3.x"
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      pip install PyYAML
  # ...rest of your steps
```

## After applying the fix

Re-run the workflow. The ModuleNotFoundError should be resolved.
