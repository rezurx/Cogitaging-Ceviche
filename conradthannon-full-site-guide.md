# Purpose Explainer: conradthannon.com and conradthannon.com/ceviche

## Overview

This document explains the purpose and function of two interlinked static websites authored under the pseudonym **Conrad T. Hannon**. It is designed to inform AI agents (like Gemini CLI) and dev collaborators of their content, architecture, and SEO roles.

---

## 1. Site: `https://conradthannon.com`

### Type:
- **Root author identity and portal site**

### Purpose:
- Establishes the digital presence of the pseudonymous writer *Conrad T. Hannon*.
- Acts as a gateway to multiple content verticals (satire, history, commentary).
- Serves as an about/contact page, directory, and SEO anchor.

### Structure:
- Static site built with Hugo or Astro.
- Minimal landing page with links to:
  - `/ceviche` (satirical commentary)
  - External profiles (Substack, Vocal, Medium)
  - Author pseudonym bio (editorial tone, not personal identity)

---

## 2. Site: `https://conradthannon.com/ceviche`

### Type:
- **Primary content hub** — called **The Cogitating Ceviche**

### Purpose:
- Hosts original essays blending satire, history, and modern commentary.
- Targets long-tail search traffic and reader engagement via evergreen + trending posts.
- Establishes topic authority for pseudonymous authorship.

### SEO Goals:
- Strong E-E-A-T signaling via consistent pseudonymous byline
- Fast performance via static build (Hugo/Astro + Netlify)
- Structured data using JSON-LD (`Article`, `WebSite`, `Breadcrumb`)
- Zero real-ID exposure (no cookies, tracking pixels, or personal PII)

### Example Content:
- “Why Plato Would Hate TikTok”
- “The Founding Fathers vs. Influencers”
- “Socrates vs. Silicon Valley”

---

## AI/CLI Agent Instructions

- **Preserve pseudonym:** Do not reference or infer real identity.
- **Prioritize SEO structure:** Canonical tags, title/meta, schema, performance.
- **Avoid personalization/tracking:** Analytics are privacy-first (Plausible only).
- **Content tone:** Smart, irreverent, historically informed, often satirical.

## Growth & Engagement Roadmap Addendum (Q3 2025)

This roadmap provides actionable growth tactics organized by platform and persona, to reinforce SEO and audience discovery for both `conradthannon.com` and `conradthannon.com/ceviche`.

---

### 1. Position First, Then Promote

**Problem:** Mixed-topic posting (UX, satire, fiction, crypto) prevents algorithmic classification.  
**Fixes:**

| Step | Action                                                                                                          | Time   |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1    | Define **3 content pillars** per persona (e.g., Conrad = satire, history, crypto culture).                     | 1h     |
| 2    | Add low-friction “If you like X, follow my Y” blurbs instead of link tweets.                                   | 15 min |
| 3    | Create landing page per persona that captures email and routes to correct Substack.                            | 2h     |

---

### 2. Substack Growth

- Enable Recommendations and do weekly Boost swaps.
- Use Substack Notes (short, engaging) daily. Respond fast.
- Monthly roundup email = new subject line, best post, reused content.

---

### 3. Medium Tactics

- Use mid-sized Topics (not obscure or generic).
- Publish through large pubs like *GEN* or *ILLUMINATION*.
- Request Boost nomination once >40% read ratio is reached.

---

### 4. Vocal.media Tips

- End each article with a question.
- Respond quickly to comments within 24h.
- Choose the most relevant Community and use 5–7 tags.

---

### 5. X.com (Twitter) Reset

- Prioritize rich media (video > image > poll > text).
- Post 3–5 spaced tweets/day. Put external links in second tweet/replies.
- Engage all replies within first 90 minutes.

---

### 6. Token Strategy: $CEVICHE + Future

- Gated Discord/Telegram for holders = early access to satire drops.
- Micro-airdrops to newsletter commenters = hype + scarcity.
- Partner with mid-tier crypto creators (guest riffs, no pay-to-play).

---

### 7. SEO Enhancements

- Use `rel="canonical"` on all cross-posts to avoid penalties.
- Auto-generate one sitemap per persona.
- Add Schema.org markup (`Article`, `Breadcrumb`) + OG tags.
- Interlink: Each post should link to one older and one newer in the same pillar.

---

### 8. Weekly Ritual

| Monday                            | Wednesday                            | Friday                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Review analytics, note top saves | 15-min reply sprint (all platforms) | Log metrics in Notion + write one experiment for next week |

---

### Results (Projection)

- **30 days**: Defined lanes, revived X engagement, +10% Substack growth
- **60 days**: Boost-eligible Medium posts, Discord >100, SEO traction
- **90 days**: Data clarity — time to double down or test ads
