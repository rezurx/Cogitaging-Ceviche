## Status: Production Ready ‚úÖ

The site has been fully optimized with professional automation. Major progress has been made on content ingestion, site structure, and deployment readiness.

Significant progress has been made on simplifying the site structure and enhancing content ingestion. The site is being reconfigured to focus solely on external articles, presented as the homepage.

## Work Completed

1.  **Content Ingestion Improvements:**
    *   **Enhanced Substack Previews:** Modified `ingest_external_articles.py` to fetch full article content from Substack URLs, generating ~100-word previews for better engagement. This includes a fallback to the default summary if full content fetching fails.
    *   **Fixed Vocal Media Links:** Corrected the `scrape_vocal_page` function in `ingest_external_articles.py` to accurately parse Vocal's `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON, resolving broken canonical URLs and ensuring correct linking.
    *   **Consistent Summary Lengths:** Implemented logic to truncate all RSS-fed article summaries (including Medium) to approximately 100 words for a uniform display.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Installed necessary Python libraries (`feedparser`, `BeautifulSoup4`, `lxml`) within the virtual environment to ensure the ingestion script runs correctly.
    *   **Article Re-ingestion:** Cleared existing articles and re-ran the `ingest_external_articles.py` script to apply all content enhancements.

2.  **Site Structure Simplification:**
    *   **Content Pruning:** Removed unnecessary content directories (`content/about`, `content/archive`, `content/essays`, `content/quick-bites`) to streamline the site.
    *   **Menu Configuration Update:** Modified `hugo.toml` to remove menu entries for the deleted sections and updated `mainSections` to only include `external-articles`.
    *   **Homepage Redesign:** Moved the `list.html` template (which displays external articles) from `layouts/_default/` to `layouts/index.html` to make the external articles list the site's main homepage.
    *   **Cache Clearing:** Cleared Hugo's `public` and `resources` build caches to ensure changes are reflected.
