# GitHub Pages Deployment Issues

## Problem
Site showing 404 at cogitating-ceviche.com despite correct DNS configuration

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Mixed Configuration Problem
- CNAME file pointing to custom domain + baseURL set to GitHub Pages URL
- Caused redirect loops and 404s

### 2. Deployment Method Confusion  
- Initially tried docs/ folder approach (GitHub Pages setting)
- Workflow configured for gh-pages branch deployment
- Conflicting deployment methods

### 3. DNS Configuration
- A records set to GitHub Pages IPs: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153
- CNAME deleted from GoDaddy
- DNS check passes on GitHub but site still 404s

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow Issues
- Git submodule errors (fixed by removing .gitmodules)
- Permission errors with git commits (simplified workflow)
- Workflows showing red X failures

## Current State
- Using gh-pages branch deployment method
- baseURL = "https://cogitating-ceviche.com" 
- No CNAME file in repo
- Workflow should auto-deploy on push to main

## Next Steps to Try
1. Check workflow run status at https://github.com/rezurx/Cogitaging-Ceviche/actions
2. Verify gh-pages branch exists and has content
3. Test direct GitHub Pages URL: https://rezurx.github.io/Cogitaging-Ceviche/
4. If direct URL works, re-add CNAME file for custom domain

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/update-content.yml` - automation workflow
- `hugo.toml` - baseURL and pagination config
- `layouts/index.html` - pagination implementation
- Removed docs/ folder entirely
