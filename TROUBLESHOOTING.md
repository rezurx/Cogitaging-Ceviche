# GitHub Pages Deployment Issues

## Problem
Site showing 404 at cogitating-ceviche.com despite correct DNS configuration

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Mixed Configuration Problem
- CNAME file pointing to custom domain + baseURL set to GitHub Pages URL
- Caused redirect loops and 404s

### 2. Deployment Method Confusion  
- Initially tried docs/ folder approach (GitHub Pages setting)
- Workflow configured for gh-pages branch deployment
- Conflicting deployment methods

### 3. DNS Configuration
- A records set to GitHub Pages IPs: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153
- CNAME deleted from GoDaddy
- DNS check passes on GitHub but site still 404s

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow Issues
- Git submodule errors (fixed by removing .gitmodules)
- Permission errors with git commits (simplified workflow)
- Workflows showing red X failures

## Current State
- Using gh-pages branch deployment method
- baseURL = "https://cogitating-ceviche.com" 
- No CNAME file in repo
- Workflow should auto-deploy on push to main
- .gitmodules file added to fix theme detection

## RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. GitHub Pages Deployment ✅
- **Problem**: Site showing repository README instead of Hugo site
- **Root Cause**: Missing workflow permissions to create gh-pages branch
- **Solution**: Added `permissions: contents: write` to workflow YAML
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Site now deploys properly

### 2. CSS/Layout Not Loading ✅  
- **Problem**: Medium-style grid layout not appearing, huge thumbnails
- **Root Cause**: baseURL mismatch - site redirects to custom domain but assets point to GitHub Pages URLs
- **Solution**: 
  - Set `baseURL = "https://cogitating-ceviche.com"`
  - Added `static/CNAME` file
  - Created proper `layouts/partials/head-additions.html` for CSS loading
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Medium-style grid now working

### 3. Workflow Permission Errors ✅
- **Problem**: `Permission to rezurx/Cogitaging-Ceviche.git denied to github-actions[bot]`
- **Solution**: Added `permissions: contents: write` to workflow
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Automation now works

## Next Steps to Try
1. Check workflow run status at https://github.com/rezurx/Cogitaging-Ceviche/actions
2. Verify gh-pages branch exists and has content
3. Check GitHub Pages source setting (should be "Deploy from branch: gh-pages")
4. Test direct GitHub Pages URL: https://rezurx.github.io/Cogitaging-Ceviche/
5. If needed, manually trigger workflow or build site locally

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/update-content.yml` - automation workflow
- `hugo.toml` - baseURL and pagination config
- `layouts/index.html` - pagination implementation
- Removed docs/ folder entirely
