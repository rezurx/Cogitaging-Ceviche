Subscribe Preface Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, revolutionized the way we understand systems: biological, mechanical, and informational. In a time when machines were still made of vacuum tubes and wires, he saw what was coming: self-regulating systems, feedback loops, predictive algorithms, and the chilling possibility that machines could eventually decide our fate without us. His warnings were sharp, his insights ahead of their time. Now imagine Wiener dropped into the very world he predicted.

This master caricaturist, lithographer, painter, and social critic chronicled 19th-century France with brutal honesty and fearless humor. Often compared to James Gillray for his visual wit and political boldness, Daumier transformed the tumult of his era into biting satire that transcended mere entertainment. His targets were legion: the monarchy, the courts, the bourgeoisie, the press. Yet his work did not merely poke fun; it accused, exposed, and demanded reflection.
