Here's what's next to finish the full asset kit for **The Cogitating Ceviche** brand site:

---

## ✅ **To-Do List (Remaining Deliverables)**

### 1. **Favicon (32×32 and 64×64)**

* Crop and simplify the fish to a clean, high-contrast icon.
* Export as `.ico` and `.png`.

### 2. **Transparent Logo PNG**

* Export the fish with no background.
* One version with just the fish, one with “The Cogitating Ceviche” in matching font.

### 3. **Palette Reference Sheet**

* Extract HEX codes:

  * 🟦 Fish blue
  * 🟨 Glasses yellow
  * 🟥 Flag red
  * 🏁 Cream/off-white
  * ⚫ Black outline
* Present them in swatches with labels.

### 4. **Style Tile**

A 1-page design reference including:

* Logo
* Typography (title + body fonts)
* Color palette
* Background texture suggestion
* Button style or accent ideas

---

## 🔧 I Will Now Generate:

* Favicon (fish icon cropped + downscaled)
* Transparent logo PNG (just the fish)
* Transparent logo PNG (with text)
* Color palette reference
* Full style tile layout

Please confirm:

1. Do you want any **tagline text** included? (e.g., “American Absurdity, Fileted for You”)
2. Do you prefer **uppercase, mixed case**, or all **lowercase** in the logo text?
3. What font style do you like for the text? (e.g., bold sans-serif, retro serif, typewriter, etc.)

Once I have that, I’ll generate and compile everything.
