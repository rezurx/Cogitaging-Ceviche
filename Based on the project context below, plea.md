# Progress Tracker: Substack RSS Feed Issue

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The Substack RSS feed issue has been successfully resolved.

## Problem Analysis

**Root Cause:** The original URL (`https://conradthannon.substack.com/feed`) was returning HTML content instead of RSS/XML feed content, causing the "Malformed RSS feed" warning.

**Solution:** Identified that Conrad T. Hannon has multiple Substack publications, and found the correct RSS feed URLs:

- **The Cogitating Ceviche**: `https://thecogitatingceviche.substack.com/feed`
- **The Cybernetic Ceviche**: `https://thecyberneticceviche.substack.com/feed`

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `ingest_external_articles.py`** with the correct feed URLs:
   - Replaced the malformed `substack` source with `cogitating-ceviche` and `cybernetic-ceviche` sources
   - Both sources point to their respective valid RSS feeds

2. **Verified functionality** by running the updated script

## Verification Results

✅ **Script runs successfully** without any malformation warnings  
✅ **Successfully ingested 20 articles** from The Cogitating Ceviche  
✅ **Successfully ingested 20 articles** from The Cybernetic Ceviche  
✅ **All existing sources continue to work** (Medium, Vocal)  

**Total articles ingested:** 40+ new articles from both Substack publications

The RSS feed ingestion is now fully functional for all configured sources.
