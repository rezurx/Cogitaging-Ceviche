# About Cogitating Ceviche

Cogitating Ceviche is a hub for ideas at the intersection of history, technology, and human systems. It brings together two distinct but complementary publications:

**The Cogitating Ceviche** — A satirical and historical lens on modern life. Here you'll find commentary that blends wit with scholarship, spotlighting overlooked thinkers, cultural oddities, and the ways our past echoes through today's technological and political landscape.

**The Cybernetic Ceviche** — A technical and forward-looking exploration of AI, UX, and human-machine systems. Articles focus on design principles, emerging tools, and the challenges of integrating advanced technologies into real-world organizations.

By combining these two perspectives, Cogitating Ceviche offers readers both critical reflection and practical insight. It is a space where satire and systems thinking meet, where cultural critique informs design, and where technology is examined not only for what it does, but for how it reshapes the human experience.
