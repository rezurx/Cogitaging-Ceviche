  - Cream background throughout site
- **Integrated fish logo** into Hugo configuration
- **Updated typography** to use serif fonts for titles

## üö® **OUTSTANDING ISSUES (For Next Session):**

### Display & Layout Issues
1. **Fish Logo Not Displaying**: Despite correct Hugo configuration and file presence
   - Logo file exists at `/static/images/fish-logo.png`
   - Hugo config correctly references logo
   - Built HTML shows correct image path
   - Issue may be theme-level or caching

2. **Left Margin Not Applied**: Page remains flush against left edge
   - CSS rules implemented with `.main-container` class
   - Used `!important` declarations
   - May need theme-specific overrides

3. **Header Link Issues**: May be redirecting to wrong URL
   - Navigation template correctly points to Substack
   - User reports seeing wrong URL path
   - Needs investigation of actual deployed behavior

4. **Title Font Not Changing**: Serif fonts not applying despite CSS rules
   - Multiple CSS selectors tried
   - May need more specific theme overrides

5. **Article Previews Not Working**: Despite scraper and template improvements
   - Enhanced scraper logic not effective
   - Promotional text still appearing in previews
   - 100-word length may not be applying correctly

### Next Session Priorities
- Debug logo display issue (check theme CSS conflicts)
- Fix left margin with theme-specific approach
- Verify header link behavior on live site
- Resolve typography styling conflicts
- **Fix article preview generation** (scraper + template issues)
