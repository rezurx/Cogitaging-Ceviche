It is a space where satire and systems thinking meet, where cultural critique informs design, and where technology is examined not only for what it does, but for how it reshapes the human experience.</p></div></article></div></main><script>const btn=document.querySelector(".nav-toggle"),links=document.getElementById("nav-links");btn&&links&&btn.addEventListener("click",()=>{const e=links.classList.toggle("show");btn.setAttribute("aria-expanded",String(e))})</script></body></html>
